Project code notes:
-------------------

This project is an updated version of the original Demo version (Unity 2.6)

All the original code has been converted to C# and all particles has been updated to suriken particle system.

Some key script that has been preserved are:

PerformanceTweak -> Updates the render Quality of the terrain and the water (Simple, reflective, Refractive) to maintain a decent FPS.

WaterLightmapFog -> Creates an underwater environment when the player is below the water surface.

Water and PostProcess effects had been updated in order to make it work in Unity 2022 LTS.
